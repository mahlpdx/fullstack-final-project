# Spotify Analytics

Spotify Analytics is interactive analytics web application using data pulled from the Spotify API. 
It allows the users to search for their favorite artist and explore data about them.

# Environment setup

To run the node server, a `.env` file must be setup in your root directory. This file should contain the following variables:<br>
1. `CLIENT_ID` - Spotify developer application client ID
2. `CLIENT_SECRET`- Spotify developer application client ID 

This information will be passed along at time of project submission. 
<br>

To run the server and the client on the same time, install concurrently in your root directory by running `npm i concurrently` and then run `npm run dev` while in the root directory.<br>

# Dependencies

To install the packages required for the project, run `npm install package.json` in both the root directory and the `client` directory.
